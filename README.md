## Introduction

The 8 Week SQL Challenge is a fantastic initiative created by Danny Ma. It offers a series of real-world business scenarios that require participants to apply SQL skills to solve them. This repository serves as a documentation of my journey through the challenge.



## Challenge Overview

The challenge consists of multiple weeks, each presenting a unique SQL problem based on a fictional business scenario. My goal is to analyze data, write SQL queries, and provide solutions to these challenges.

Feel free to explore each week's folder to see my progress and solutions.

## SQL Concepts

Throughout the challenge, I will be using various SQL concepts and techniques, such as:

- SQL queries for data extraction and analysis.
- JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables.
- Aggregation functions for summarizing data.
- Window functions for advanced analytics.
- Subqueries for nested queries.
- And more!

## Solutions

In each week's folder, you will find SQL scripts and queries I've used to solve the challenges. I encourage you to review, comment, or provide feedback on my solutions.
